//! Functions and data structures for construction, representation, and
//! compilation/evaluation of the abstract syntax tree.
//!
//! Semantically, the AST consists of a top-level Rule node, which contains
//! UserFunction nodes, which contain Statement nodes, which contain Expr
//! ("expression") nodes. Expr nodes may contain other Expr nodes.
//!
//! Statement and Expr nodes are actually owned by the UserFunction, and they
//! are more often manipulated using StatementRef and ExprRef structs, which
//! contain an identifier that can be used to retrieve them from a UserFunction.
//! (UserFunction implements Index<StatementRef> and Index<ExprRef> for this.)
