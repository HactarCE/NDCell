Some types in NDCell are implicitly converted to other types when used with various operators or passed to functions.

.. vector-vector-conversion

Vector to vector conversion
===========================

If the new length is longer than the original length, the vector is extended with zeros. If the new length is shorter than the original length, the vector is truncated and extra components are removed.

Examples:

.. _integer-vector-conversion

Integer to vector conversion
============================

.. _cell-to-cell-filter-conversion

Cell to cell filter conversion
===============================
